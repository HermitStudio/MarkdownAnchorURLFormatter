# Markdown Anchor URL Formatter

## What is this tool used for?

When you want to link within a markdown article to another section within the same page, you need to use an anchor link. In markdown this is done by taking the text in a level two heading and formatting it into a URL it can understand. However, when special characters get involved, you don't always know exactly how it should be formatted, and you have to use trial and error until you can get it to work. This tool was created to generate the markdown anchor URL for you.
